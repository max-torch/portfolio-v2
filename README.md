# Alexander Lacson's Portfolio

This is my portfolio website. It is based on the [Freelancer](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer/) theme by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/). I have modified it to fit my needs and to showcase my projects.

## Freelance Theme's Technology Stack

The Freelancer theme is built using Node.js, Pug, and SCSS during its development process. The final HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are generated by compiling the source Pug and SCSS files. Node.js serves as the runtime environment for executing the build scripts responsible for generating the end files.

## Deployment

GitHub Actions is used to deploy the website to GitHub Pages and is triggered whenever a commit is pushed to the `master` branch.

## Development

Run `npm start` to start live preview while developing.

## Template Credits

This portfolio website is based on the [Freelancer](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer/) template, which is available for free on [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/).
